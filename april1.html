I got ready for the trek to the other end of the house to wake up the kid. The 7:30am news came on. I was still sleepy. â€œThe actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman is dead.â€ I was only half listening. I'd seen his work but have never been one to pay much attention to famous personalities or celebrities. â€œHe was forty-six.â€ That caught half my attention â€“ the same age as me. â€œFrom a heroin overdose.â€ There I was, sitting on the edge of my bed with a syringe full of heroin in my hand. All at once I felt a kindred with someone I had never known. I knew a couple of characters he'd played, I knew his name, but that was it. Now suddenly, he was a lot like me.When you're addicted to heroin, It's generally a long-running, close relationship.  There are plenty of bad times, but there are also gems that stay with you. It's like family â€“ a parent, sibling or child. You may swear that for all they've put you through, you never want anything to do with them again, but there's always that part of you that misses the good times and wonders how you'd get along now. When I first gave up heroin, I could never tell myself it was forever. I could not imagine never entering that cosy cocoon again.</div><div class="source">Linda</div><div class="yearsClean">still using</div><div class="location">Geelong, Australia</div></div></div><div class="quoteContainer"><div class="mainQuote">I see what happened to Philip Seymour Hoffman everyday in my hometown</div><div class="readMore">Read more</div><div class="moreInfo"><div class="wholeQuote">My father died from addiction, we lost a cousin, I myself had numerous overdoses and helped prevent siblings from OD-ing (all of who are now clean thanks to the process of one addict helping another that Russell Brand spoke of). Hearing about Hoffman affects me the same way as if it were a friend. I didnt know he was an addict untill he died, but when I heard of his story and addiction I immediatly identified with him. We work the same way in our minds. I know what happened to him before he picked up. I know how he felt. I'm pretty sure it started the same way most relapses do. </div><div class="source">Danny</div><div class="yearsClean">10 years clean</div><div class="location">Dublin, Ireland</div></div></div><div class="quoteContainer"><div class="mainQuote">I live in real fear that I'll relapse</div><div class="readMore">Read more</div><div class="moreInfo"><div class="wholeQuote">This is what scares me late at night: If somebody like Hoffman had gone so long without smack (heroin), and just jumped back in one day â€“ how close am I to doing the same?

Heroin doesn't discriminate. It is unbearably wonderful for surpressing pain and generating a false sense of well-being. I loved heroin. Addicts who say â€œI hate heroinâ€ are lying to themselves. We wouldn't stick needles in our arms daily if we didn't love the way it made us feel. But when it wears off, you're in a hole so big its impossible to climb out.

I am at a stage now where I'm starting to feel good again about myself and my life. But Hoffman's death has aroused a whole new fresh public discourse around heroin addiction, and I must say that its effect on me has not resulted in feelings of sorrow, or relief, but thoughts and feelings of nostalgia. The fact that nostalgic thoughts and feelings have been aroused from hearing about the tragic death of this great actor, just shows how utterly irrational the addicted mind is. It's not thoughts of relief that I have, such as â€œWow that could have been me, I'm so lucky.â€ But rather it is thoughts of reminiscence; thoughts of how euphoric he must have felt in those last few weeks of relapse, or even in his last few moments. The addicted mind is a selfish mind, no doubt, but also an utterly helpless one.</div><div class="source">Sean</div><div class="yearsClean">three months clean</div><div class="location">Leeds, UK</div></div></div><div class="quoteContainer"><div class="mainQuote">It's easy to think that because you have been clean and sober for so long that using one time will be OK.

That's why I attend 12-step meetings, so that I dont forget what it was like, to remind myself that I'm only one drink or drug away from the person I once was.

My addiction was born out of an intense lack of self esteem and severe childhood trauma, and my continued drug use was simply terror at feeling exposed in a world that I felt I had no skills to negotiate. Heroin was a buffer between me and the harshness of humanity, and giving it up was the scariest thing I've ever done.</div><div class="source">Kylie</div><div class="yearsClean">19 years clean</div><div class="location">Wollongong, Australia</div></div></div><div class="quoteContainer"><div class="mainQuote">The media's â€˜It's so sadâ€™, â€˜How could this happen?â€™ style coverage of a celebrity overdose pisses me right off</div><div class="readMore">Read more</div><div class="moreInfo"><div class="wholeQuote">I'm the recovering child and grandchild of addicts.The media's 'It's so sad', 'How could this happen?' style coverage of a celebrity overdose pisses me right off, frankly.

There is endless waiting for acquaintances whose own broken facades sicken you and remind you of the road you are travelling. There are bailiffs, policemen and rip-off merchants to contend with. There are panicked rushes to inject in public toilets, a desperation to hide injection sites from employers (if you can manage to keep a job as I did) and perpetual fear of a crack down.

Welcome to a whole new game of heroin addiction, needle fixation and vein degradation. Now the game is in a different league, the complications and ramifications are endless but they all lead to one road, an ever increasing addiction.

Four young men. I went to high school with three of them: one overdosed in his senior year, one in his freshman year of college, one last year. They were all extremely intelligent and gifted.  Opiates are especially manipulative, because you get outside of your consciousness. Fears you didn't know you had, suddenly vanish. Though the experience of a drug is a romantic and nostalgic feeling, addiction is not. It's ugly and selfish, because it is so bodily. It is both metaphorical and biological, it is hunger for emotion, and chemical alteration.

Now, I always try to be vigilant for the signs of mental illness in others, and help to support my friends who struggle with addiction and depression as I once did. The temptation of addiction isnâ€™t a constant pull that diminishes over time; it ebbs and flows corresponding with the powerful emotions that lead to such harmful escapism in the first place. The concept of triggers is very important to understand; certain events, places, people and emotions serve as a catalyst to invoke the temptation to fall back on oneâ€™s progress. I can go for months without being tempted to use, but if something happens to trigger my need, the craving comes back as fresh as it was the very first week of sobriety. </div><div class="source">Jack</div><div class="yearsClean">nine months clean</div><div class="location">Texas, US</div></div></div><div class="quoteContainer"><div class="mainQuote"> It shames me to write this now, but I did continue using â€“ mainlining â€“ for the first few months of the pregnancy</div><div class="readMore">Read more</div><div class="moreInfo"><div class="wholeQuote">Hardly anyone in my current life knows my history of drug addiction.

It shames me to write this now, but I did continue using - mainlining, for the first few months of the pregnancy, but once I felt the baby moving, I had enough motivation to stop. I had reduced my use once I found I was pregnant, so I didn't have extreme physical withdrawals. After the baby was born, I did use on a few occasions, but never mainlined again.

It keeps me scared straight. I double up on meetings. Pray, work my steps and work with my sponsees. I am one drink or drug away from a relapse ... A living hell if not death. Do I have another high in me? Yes. Do I have another clean and sobering up? I don't know. </div><div class="source">Cris</div><div class="yearsClean">27 years clean</div><div class="location">Fort Worth, Texas</div></div></div><div class="quoteContainer"><div class="mainQuote">We get deaths like this every few months, either in the media or in our recovery community</div><div class="readMore">Read more</div><div class="moreInfo"><div class="wholeQuote">I attend a 12 step program where we were all shaken by the Hoffman overdose.

Hearing and reading about it in the news doesn't make me want to stay clean but it creates these urges to use again. I'm not sure if It's because as an addict I have a self destructive persona or because I miss that dark abyss. All I know is that hearing about these high profile over doses doesn't make me thankful to be clean but it brings out the curiosity within me. What if that was me?
